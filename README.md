# Statistical-Analysis-2
In this notebook I perform Statistical Analysis using the Wine Dataset(The wine dataset contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in a specific area of Italy) and Stack Overflow dataset( That is an overiew of data from jobs on stack overflow)
I implment several statistical techniques like:
- Checking the percentage of data within 3std
- The Shapiroâ€“Wilk test
- Standard Error
- Z-Score 
- Confidence Interval
- T-Test(using st.ttest_ind & st.ttest_1samp)
- Chi squared test (st.chi2_contingency)
